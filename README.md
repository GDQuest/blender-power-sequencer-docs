# Blender Power Sequencer docs

Source repository for [Power Sequencer](https://github.com/GDquest/Blender-power-sequencer/), the Open Source Blender add-on for video makers.

To read the documentation, head to the [ add-on's GitHub wiki ](https://github.com/GDquest/Blender-power-sequencer/wiki). We use this repository to write the documentation with other contributors and collect videos.

## Docs writing tips

- Use simple English
- Show picture/GIF at the top:  it might better convey what the tool does than a text 
- Use h2 `##` for the first title and h3 `###` for sub-sections 
- Avoid passive voice when possible (is used, are processed, etc. -> XX uses, XX processes)
