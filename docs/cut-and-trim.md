## Cut and trim - WIP

Cut and trim operations will use the mouse position to determine the frame to cut.

Keyobard shortcuts are the quickest way to activate these operations, but they
also can be accessed by the [operator search pop-up
menu](https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/dev/interface/controls/templates/operator_search.html).

### Cut a single strip

1. Put the mouse cursor over the strip that you want to cut
2. Use the shortcut: <kbd>Ctrl</kbd><kbd>+</kbd><kbd>Action Mouse</kbd>

### Cut all strips 

![Cut all strips GIF](./gifs/mouse-cut-all.gif)

1. Put the mouse cursor on the sequencer, without hovering on any strips
2. Use the shortcut: <kbd>Ctrl</kbd><kbd>+</kbd><kbd>Action Mouse</kbd>

**Trick**: this operator can also be used to cut gaps between strips.
